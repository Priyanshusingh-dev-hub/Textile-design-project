"""Number a COLOURED design: every patch of one colour gets a number.

`textile number design.png --out o/`: the user's way to plan a sketch from a
finished colour design. The design is read at --size (3535 px wide by
default), cleaned of weave/print grain (a 5 px median at its own scale), cut
to its distinct inks (paint._ref_palette: k-means 16 in CIELAB, shades closer
than dE 30 are one ink, at most --colors), and every connected patch of one
ink (4-connected, as the sketch areas are) is an area. Grain is melted (see
`patches`: specks under --min-area px, and thin or ragged flecks lying inside
one other patch; small round dots are kept). Then:

  NAME_numbers.png   the coloured design, each patch outlined, its number on it
                     (paint's numbers sheet: inside when it fits, else a dot and
                     a blue number beside it; it grows until every number has a place)
  NAME_flat.png      the design as those flat inks (what was numbered)
  NAME_sketch_seal0.png        the colours taken away: a 2 px black line where two patches meet, on
                     white. Its areas, as `textile paint` finds them (seal 0: the name says so), ARE the numbers
  NAME_sketch_numbers.png      that sketch with the numbers
  NAME_colors.csv    Number, HEX, Colour, share %: the same CSV `textile paint`
                     reads, so a sketch drawn to these patches can be painted with it

Nothing is printed from here: no package, no mill file. It is a map to work from.
