"""`fill --method auto`'s choice, in one place for the CLI and the LoomLab app.

Method 1, judged: it fails when its alignment is under `min_align`, or when
the share of each colour differs from the reference's by more than
`max_cover_diff` points in all (half the sum of the differences): on the tree
panel Method 1 gave the cream motif 10% where the reference has ~31% (13.7+
points), while the floral and star, filled right, differ by 1.7 and 3.2.
A failed Method 1 with two colours goes to Method 2; otherwise to Method 3,
judged the same way; if that fails too the shapes meet nowhere (a different
drawing) and Method 2 builds them from the line art alone, in the
reference's two main colours (`only_two`: said plainly).
